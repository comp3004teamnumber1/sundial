Discussion
- Discussed my buggy implementation heavily with Vinh (2hrs)

Development
- (Buggily) implemented reading the login payload, after refactoring user settings because iOS crashes with saving the current implementation (2hrs)
- Some stuff from last week (most notably the /settings implementation) is very buggy, due to the settings key in the local storage not containing the expected values, so I spent alo

Am still debugging stuff if I'm being honest.
