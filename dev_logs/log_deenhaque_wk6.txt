Research
- Concluded that AWS lambdas may not be an ideal server host (databases are set using AWS' DynamoDB, but our backend has a database all set up already) (1hr)

Deliverables
- Worked on D2 with the group (3hrs)

Honestly, kind of had a lot going on this week, so I couldn't do too much. Sorry guys :(
